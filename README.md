## About the Project
This project is to design an educational game activity for the 2021 ASEAN Experiential Learning Programme (AELP), a biannual event hosted for university student representatives from the universities in the ASEAN University Network (AUN). The student representatives will visit the host countries for an opportunity of experiential learning based on the content introduced by the host university. Our team is tasked to design an educational game that centers on the theme of Smart Nation in Singapore, as Singapore aims to be a Smart Nation by 2030.

## About the Applications
To facilitate the game activity, the following are 3 applications designed for different groups of stakeholders in the activity.
* User Application - mobile application for the participants playing in the game activity.
* Facilitator Application - mobile application for the organisers and facilitators managing the activity.
* Overall Dashboard - a mobile application that can be broadcasted for all stakeholders to see the progress of the activity.

The applications are build on Android with the Java programming languages. The details on the 3 applications can be found in our [documentation](https://github.com/Teo-KJ/Project-AELP/blob/master/Mobile%20Applications%20Documentation.pdf).
